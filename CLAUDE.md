# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal Python project containing a single empty file `getdailystocks.py`. The repository currently has no dependencies, build system, or testing framework configured.

## Development Commands

Since this is a bare-bones Python project with no configuration files:

- **Run the script**: `python getdailystocks.py`
- **Format code**: Use standard Python formatting tools like `black` or `autopep8` when code is added
- **Lint code**: Use `flake8`, `pylint`, or `ruff` when code is added

## Architecture

The project structure is minimal:
- `getdailystocks.py` - Empty Python script (likely intended for stock data retrieval based on name)

## Notes

- No git repository initialized
- No package management (requirements.txt, setup.py, etc.) 
- No testing framework configured
- No CI/CD or development tooling present

This appears to be a fresh project setup that will likely need dependencies and structure added as development progresses.
